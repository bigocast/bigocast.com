Let’s imagine you have a pile of books and want to organize them into your books collection alphabetically. How would you do that?

You can pick up the top book from the pile and put it on the shelf, then pick up the next one and decide if you have to put it before the first book or after that. Every time you can pick up one book and put it in the right place among the books on the shelf and continue up to the point that no books remain in the pile. This approach is called “Insertion Sort”.
